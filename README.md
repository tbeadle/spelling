This is just a little project I'm putting together to help my wife who
homeschools our children to have a way to test their spelling skills by entering
in the words for their test.  Then, when the child goes to take the test, it
will say the word and he must type in his answer.  This will hopefully help
them to enjoy learning how to spell as well as improve typing skills.  It will
track results and hopefully show progress over time.
